"It can be illuminating to depict a scope graph graphically.
In a scope graph diagramï¼š
1. a scope is depicted as a circle,
2. a reference as a box with an arrow pointing into the scope that contains it, and a declaration as"

A scope is an abstraction over a group of nodes in the abstract syntax tree
that behave uniformly with respect to name resolution.

Each program has a scope graph G, whose nodes are a finite set of scopes S(G).

Every program has at least one scope, the global or root scope.

Each scope S has an associated finite set D(S) of declarations and finite set R(S) of references (at particular
program positions), and each declaration and reference in a program belongs to a unique scope.

A scope is the atomic grouping for name resolution:
- each reference x_i^R in a scope resolves to a declaration of the same variable x_j^D in the scope, if one exists.

Intuitively, a single scope corresponds to a group of mutually recursive definitions, e.g., a letrec block, the declarations

in a module, or the set of top-level bindings in a program.
